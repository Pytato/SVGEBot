# SVGEBot
The new, pythonic, all singing, all dancing bot for SVGE.
Hopefully should be rather easy to maintain, and with the power 
of Python, rather understandable, even with currently limited 
commenting :-).

Trello would probably be a good idea.

Currently getting proper MariaDB implementation working 
on the bot (and making it somewhat generalised). 
If you notice any major SQL injection vulnerabilities that 
I've missed in my goings over, please let me know/commit 
a fix, thanks.

Bots, the final frontier, these are the voyages of the team 
SVGE-dev. It's continuing its mission: to explore strange 
coding practices, to seek out new and novel techniques, to 
go boldly where no one has gone before.
